  README
  
  The purpose of Program 3 is to help the user to stay current with the current C++
  over the summer. In order to do that the program will read a file with already
  build-in questions and the user will have the opportunity to review the questions. 
  In addition, the user will be able to add more questions to that file,
  and mark the questions that have been already reviewed.
  Using a structure, the questions will be stored
  with numbers, type, difficulty, and notation if are completed or not.
